# Introduction
This is a console program that allows you to quickly translate texts into different languages.
Written in Python 3.7.3 using the [googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/) module.

# Documentation
### Theory
To control the program, text commands are used. If the input starts with ":", then the program considers it a command. Otherwise, the program considers this text to be translated.

**Destination language** - language to translate.

**Source language** - language to translate from.

*You can change **destination** and **source** language with some commands.*
